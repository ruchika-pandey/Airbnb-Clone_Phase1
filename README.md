# Airbnb-Clone_Phase1
Developed a full-stack Airbnb clone using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js, delivering a dynamic, user-friendly web application mimicking a modern booking platform.

Designed a responsive front-end with React and CSS (style.css), utilizing EJS templates (index.ejs, navbar.ejs, footer.ejs, new.ejs, show.ejs, boilerplate.ejs) for seamless content rendering.

Built a robust backend with Express and Node.js (app.js), integrated with MongoDB for efficient data storage and retrieval, enabling features like property listings and user navigation. Ensured cross-device compatibility through responsive design principles.

Planning future phases to add advanced features like booking systems, user authentication, and search filters to enhance functionality and user experience. 

This project showcases my ability to build scalable, full-stack applications with a focus on seamless UI/UX.
